## The Philosophy: Your Attention is Sacred

> In a world of constant distraction, your ability to focus is a superpower. Flow is built on a simple idea: **one thing at a time**. It's not about complex productivity metrics or chasing a never-ending task list. It's about creating a clear, intentional boundary around your work, allowing you to engage deeply and mindfully.
>
> Flow helps you answer a simple question: "What am I working on right now?" And by logging your completed sessions, it helps you reflect on a more important one: "How am I investing my attention?"

## Features

- **Mindful Focus**: A single active session at a time to encourage deep, single-tasking work.
- **Rich Dashboard**: A beautiful, GitHub-style contribution graph to visualize your focus history over the last year.
- **Powerful Exports**: Export your work sessions to CSV or JSON for invoicing, analysis, or personal records.
- **Privacy First**: Your data is yours. Everything is stored locally in plain text files. No cloud, no tracking.
- **Shell Integration**: Seamlessly display your current focus session in your shell prompt (`bash` and `zsh` supported).
- **Automation Hooks**: Trigger custom scripts on session events (`on_start`, `on_pause`, `on_end`).

## Installation

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/e6a5/flow/main/install.sh | bash
```
*The installer will add the `flow` binary to `/usr/local/bin` and check for necessary dependencies.*

For other installation methods (Go, manual), see the [Installation Guide](docs/INSTALL.md).

## Getting Started: A Typical Workflow

Flow is designed to be intuitive. Here's how a typical session works:

1.  **Start a session** when you're ready to focus. Give it a tag to describe your task.
    ```bash
    flow start --tag "Writing the first draft of the new feature spec"
    ```

2.  **Check your status** at any time.
    ```bash
    flow status
    > ðŸŒŠ Deep work: Writing the first draft of the new feature spec (Active for 1h 15m)
    ```

3.  **Take a break** when you need one.
    ```bash
    flow pause
    ```
    Then, **resume** when you're ready to get back to it.
    ```bash
    flow resume
    ```

4.  **End the session** when the work is complete. Your focus time is automatically logged.
    ```bash
    flow end
    > âœ¨ Session complete: Writing the first draft of the new feature spec
    > Total focus time: 2h 30m
    ```

## Gain Insights from Your Work

Once you've logged a few sessions, you can use Flow's data tools to understand your work patterns.

- **Visualize your consistency** with the dashboard. The color of each day represents your total focus time:
  - **Lightest Blue**: 1 minute - 2 hours
  - **Light Blue**: 2 - 4 hours
  - **Medium Blue**: 4 - 6 hours
  - **Darkest Blue**: More than 6 hours
  ```bash
  flow dashboard
  ```

- **Review your session history**:
  ```bash
  flow log --week --stats
  ```
- **Export your data for invoicing or analysis**:
  ```bash
  flow export --month 2023-10 --format csv --output "october-invoice.csv"
  ```
