```

## Usage

```bash
flow start --tag "writing docs"   # Enter deep work
flow status                       # Check current session
flow pause                        # Take a mindful break
flow resume                       # Continue working

## What It Does

* Creates a mindful boundary around your work
* Maintains one focused session at a time
* Runs quietly in background while you work
* Provides gentle awareness of current focus
* Respects natural work rhythms with pause/resume

## Philosophy

Flow is not a productivity app.  
It's a ritual for protecting attention.  
It's a boundary you place around your mind.

Following Unix philosophy, Flow does one thing well: session boundaries.  
Following Zenta spirit, it serves consciousness, not metrics.

## Core Commands

| Command | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `start` | Begin deep work session | `flow start --tag "refactoring"` |
| `status` | Check current session | `flow status` |
| `pause` | Mindful break | `flow pause` |
| `resume` | Continue working | `flow resume` |
| `end` | Complete session | `flow end` |

## Examples

### Starting Work
```bash
# Begin focused work
flow start --tag "writing documentation"

üåä Starting deep work: writing documentation
   Clear your mind
   Focus on what matters  
   Let distractions pass
Session active in background.
```

### Checking Progress
```bash
flow status
üåä Deep work: writing documentation
Active for 1h 23m.
```

### Taking Breaks
```bash
flow pause
‚è∏Ô∏è  Paused: writing documentation
Worked for 1h 23m. Use 'flow resume' when ready.

# Later...
flow resume
üåä Resumed: writing documentation
Continue your deep work.
```

### Completing Work
```bash
flow end
‚ú® Session complete: writing documentation
Total focus time: 2h 15m
Carry this focus forward.
```

## Composing with Zenta

```bash
flow end && zenta           # Breathe after completion
flow start --tag "deep work" # Enter focus
flow pause && zenta now     # Mindful break
```

## Design Principles

- üßò **Mindful**: Ritual approach, not productivity hack
- üéØ **Focused**: One session at a time, no multitasking
- üîí **Private**: No tracking, no cloud, purely local
- üåø **Gentle**: Respects natural work rhythms
- üîÑ **Simple**: Clean Unix-like commands
- üí´ **Present**: Awareness without optimization

## Why Flow?

**Real vs Fake Focus Tools:**

‚úÖ **Real (Flow's way):**
- Creates sacred space for work
- One thing at a time enforcement  
- Mindful boundaries, not metrics
- Serves attention, not productivity

‚ùå **Fake:**
- Tracking productivity scores
- Optimizing work performance
- Gamifying focus time
- Measuring output metrics
