## A Typical Workflow

Flow is designed to be intuitive. Here's how a typical session works:

1.  **Start a session** when you're ready to focus. Give it a tag and a target duration.

    ```bash
    flow start --tag "Writing the first draft" --target 2h
    ```

2.  **Check your status** at any time to see your progress.

    ```bash
    flow status
    > ðŸŒŠ Deep work: Writing the first draft (Active for 45m) / 2h 0m (1h 15m remaining)
    ```

3.  **End the session** when the work is complete. Your focus time is automatically logged.

    ```bash
    flow end
    > âœ¨ Session complete: Writing the first draft
    > Total focus time: 2h 5m
    ```
4. **Review your day** and find your patterns.
    ```bash
    flow recent
    flow insights
    ```

## Goals and Insights: Understand Your Work

Flow is more than a timer; it's a tool for building habits. Once you've logged a few sessions, you can use its data tools to understand and improve your work patterns.

- **Set a daily goal** to build consistency:
  ```bash
  flow goal --set 4h
  ```
  Check your progress at any time:
  ```bash
  flow goal
  > ðŸŽ¯ Daily Goal: 2h 5m / 4h 0m (52%)
  ```

- **Review today's progress** with the `recent` command:
  ```bash
  flow recent
  > âœ¨ Today's Completed Sessions âœ¨
  >
  >   - Writing the first draft (2h 5m)
  >
  > Total focus time today: 2h 5m
  ```

- **Discover your patterns** with `insights`:
  ```bash
  flow insights
  > ðŸ“Š Your Focus Insights (based on 42 sessions)
  > ----------------------------------------------------
  > Busiest Day:            Thursday
  >   - You focus an average of 2h 15m on Thursdays.
  >   - Your average on other days is 1h 10m.
  >
  > Top Activities (by time):
  >   - coding:      18h 5m (51%)
  >   - writing:     9h 45m (28%)
  > ----------------------------------------------------
  ```

- **Visualize your consistency** with the dashboard:
  ```bash
  flow dashboard
  ```

- **Export your data for invoicing or analysis**:
  ```bash
  flow export --month 2023-10 --format csv
  ```
