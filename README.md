# üåä Flow

> A Command-Line Tool for Deep Work

Flow is a minimalist command-line tool designed to help you focus on single-tasking by creating a mindful boundary around your work. It emphasizes mindfulness and presence, not productivity metrics.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### Install (one-liner)

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/e6a5/flow/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Start a Session

```bash
flow start --tag "writing docs"
```

### Enable Shell Integration (Optional)

For ambient awareness in your shell prompt:

```bash
# For bash users
echo 'eval "$(flow completion bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc

# For zsh users  
echo 'eval "$(flow completion zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

## üé£ Automation Hooks

Flow supports automation hooks that trigger on session events. Create executable scripts in `~/.config/flow/hooks/`:

- `on_start` - Triggered when starting a session
- `on_pause` - Triggered when pausing a session  
- `on_resume` - Triggered when resuming a session
- `on_end` - Triggered when ending a session

Each hook receives the session tag as its first argument.

Example hook (`~/.config/flow/hooks/on_start`):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Starting work on: $1" | notify-send "Flow" 
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

Flow follows XDG Base Directory standards:

- **Session data**: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/flow/session` (default: `~/.local/share/flow/session`)
- **Hooks**: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/flow/hooks/` (default: `~/.config/flow/hooks/`)
- **Custom session path**: Set `FLOW_SESSION_PATH` environment variable
