## The Flow Philosophy

Flow is built on a few core principles that guide its design and purpose.

*   **Mindful Focus, Not Just Time Tracking.** Flow isn't about logging hours for a timesheet. It's about creating a ritual around deep work, helping you build the habit of single-tasking.

*   **Your Terminal is Your Sanctuary.** Deep work happens when you eliminate distractions. Flow lives in the command line, your most focused environment, preventing the context-switching required by GUI apps.

*   **Your Data is Yours. Period.** Flow is private by default. It works offline, requires no account, and stores all your data in simple, local text files. You have complete control.

*   **Compose Your Perfect Workflow.** Flow embraces the Unix philosophy. It's a simple, powerful tool that can be scripted and combined with others. Use its hooks to integrate with your existing setup.

## Quick Start

1. **Install Flow**:
   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/e6a5/flow/main/install.sh | bash
   ```

2. **Start your first session**:
   ```bash
   flow start --tag "My first deep work session"
   ```

3. **Check your progress**:
   ```bash
   flow status
   ```

4. **End when complete**:
   ```bash
   flow end
   ```

## A Typical Workflow

Flow is designed to be intuitive. Here's how a typical session works:

1.  **Start a session** when you're ready to focus. Give it a tag and a target duration.

    ```bash
    flow start --tag "Writing the first draft" --target 2h
    ```

2.  **Check your status** at any time to see your progress.

    ```bash
    flow status
    > ðŸŒŠ Deep work: Writing the first draft (Active for 45m) / 2h 0m (1h 15m remaining)
    ```

3.  **End the session** when the work is complete. Your focus time is automatically logged.

    ```bash
    flow end
    > âœ¨ Session complete: Writing the first draft
    > Total focus time: 2h 5m
    ```

4. **Review your day** and find your patterns.
   ```bash
   flow recent
   flow insights
   ```

5. **Clean up if needed** - Remove any test sessions or mistakes.
   ```bash
   flow delete
   ```
